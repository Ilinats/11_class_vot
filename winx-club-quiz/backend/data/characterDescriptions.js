    // Women Characters
    Bloom: { description: "Oh, wow, look at you—playing the heroic redhead who thinks she's the savior of the world. You’re probably the type to step into a room and expect everyone to just bow down to your ‘special’ aura. Sure, you’ve got the heart, but we all know you can’t go five minutes without reminding us how important *you* are. Maybe the world would be a little less ‘fiery’ if you kept your drama to yourself for once.",

    Stella: { description: "You’re a walking Instagram filter, aren’t you? A little sunshine and a whole lot of ‘me, me, me.’ Sure, you might save the day, but only after your third wardrobe change and making sure your followers know what you’re up to. You don’t care if the sky is falling as long as your hair looks perfect when it happens. You’ve got ‘princess’ vibes but somehow everyone else ends up doing the heavy lifting while you catch some rays.",

    Musa: {description: "We get it, you’re so deep. You have ‘feelings’ no one else understands. You’re probably sitting in a corner listening to some obscure band no one’s ever heard of, judging everyone else for not having your ‘sophisticated’ taste. But let’s face it, you’re just trying way too hard. Keep doing your emotional ‘soul-searching,’ and we’ll keep pretending it’s impressive.",

    Layla: {description: "Athletic, strong, and always ready to take charge—but let’s not forget the *real* reason you’re so ‘independent.’ You’re only in it for the action. If there’s a fight, you’ll be right there, but as soon as someone mentions ‘feelings,’ you’re suddenly too busy to talk. Sure, you’ll save the day, but only if it involves a gym workout or a good sparring match. Let’s be real, you’re just waiting for someone to *finally* challenge you.",

    Tecna: {description: "Oh, the robot girl, right? Sure, you’re brilliant, but did it ever occur to you that maybe you should try talking to people like a human once in a while? Maybe *not* using an algorithm to figure out how to make friends would be a start. Your brain is probably ten times smarter than everyone else, but you’ve got the emotional depth of a toaster. But hey, at least you know how to save the world with your 'superior intellect,' right?",

    Flora: {description: "You might have a heart of gold, but it’s wrapped in a whole lot of passive-aggressiveness. You’re the type who’ll smile through a problem but then drop some 'subtle' hints about how *everyone* is making your life miserable. You want to be the ‘peacekeeper,’ but let’s be real: you’re a time bomb of suppressed frustration just waiting to go off. Try being a little less ‘perfect’ for once, maybe?",

    Icy: {description: "Ice queen, huh? We get it, you’re cold and ruthless. You’ll freeze anyone who stands in your way, but deep down, you probably just need a hug. Too bad you won’t let anyone get close enough to give you one. You’re that person who hides behind their power and throws tantrums when things don’t go your way. But hey, at least your icy demeanor keeps people from seeing how emotionally unstable you really are.",

    Darcy: {description: "You’re the definition of ‘don’t mess with me.’ Sure, you’re evil, but you’ve got your *reasons*—probably. You’ve mastered the art of manipulation and mind games, and you know exactly how to get under people’s skin. Everyone else might be too scared to notice, but we all know you’re just a little too obsessed with proving how much better you are than everyone else. But hey, you do make an excellent villain—congratulations on being a total nightmare.",

    },
    
    Stormy: {description: "Oh, you’re a storm waiting to happen, all right. You’re loud, chaotic, and you love the sound of your own voice when it’s screeching at everyone to ‘get it together!’ Honestly, you’re probably just mad because you never get invited to the cool kids' table. So instead, you throw tantrums and cause drama. Don’t worry, though—someone’s bound to throw you a bone eventually, even if you destroy half the town in the process.",

    Diaspro: {description: "The spoiled princess who thinks the world revolves around her. Sure, you’ve got money and power, but you’ve also got a *huge* ego that probably needs a reality check. You’ve been living in your own little bubble for so long, you’ve forgotten that not everyone cares about your ‘perfect’ life. Maybe if you came down from your ivory tower once in a while, people might actually like you.",

    // Men Characters
    Sky: {description: "The perfect knight in shining armor—well, at least until you open your mouth and start overthinking everything. You’re a master at looking heroic in battle, but let’s be honest, you’re more about the inner conflict than actually getting things done. You’ll spend half the time staring into space wondering if you’re making the right decision, while everyone else has already moved on. Maybe next time, try *thinking* less and doing more.",
        image: "https://i.pinimg.com/564x/55/ce/90/55ce90953f89568c359281f067999e16.jpg"

    Brandon: {description: "The charming, funny guy who thinks his witty remarks will win everyone over. News flash: Not everyone’s impressed with your jokes. You act like you’re too cool for school, but deep down, you’re just afraid people will realize you’re a little bit clueless. You try to be the ‘funny’ one, but you’re really just avoiding your own issues by pretending to be everyone’s friend. At least you keep things entertaining, though.",

    Valtor: {description: "You’re the guy who’s got *all* the power but no one’s buying into your ‘I’m evil, deal with it’ act anymore. You’ve got a plan for everything, but your arrogance is really starting to show. Just because you’re dark and mysterious doesn’t mean you’re interesting. You’re like that kid who tries too hard to be edgy and ends up just looking pathetic. Maybe it’s time to ditch the whole ‘villain’ thing, huh?",

    Riven: {description: "Mr. Bad Boy himself, the guy who *thinks* he’s the center of attention but is actually just an emotionally unavailable mess. You’re probably one meltdown away from completely losing it, but you won’t let anyone see that side of you—too bad it’s becoming painfully obvious. You act like you don’t care, but we all know you’re just terrified of showing vulnerability. Keep pretending to be tough; it’s working... for now.",

    Helia: {description: "You’re the brooding artist who thinks your ‘dark, mysterious’ persona makes you more attractive. Spoiler alert: It doesn’t. You’re the type who sits in a corner staring at a canvas while everyone else has real conversations. You think you’re ‘deep,’ but you’re just hiding behind your art because you’re scared of facing your actual feelings. Maybe one day you’ll stop avoiding life and join the rest of us. Just a thought.",

    Timmy: {description: "The quiet genius who’s probably more comfortable with a laptop than a human being. Sure, you know *everything,* but you also don’t know how to talk to people without coming off as a total weirdo. You’re probably the guy who’s coding the next big thing while everyone else is having fun. But hey, at least you’re the one who saves the day, right? Just don’t forget to leave your cave every once in a while.",
        image: "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/99/92/f6/9992f6cb7ca1366b9a3f0f6b64873e6f.jpg"
    },
    
    Nabu: {description: "The mystical guy who thinks he’s ‘in touch’ with the universe, but in reality, you’re probably just Googling ‘how to be mysterious.’ You’re one of those people who loves talking about ‘energy’ and ‘vibes,’ but at the end of the day, you can’t seem to figure out how to have a normal conversation without sounding pretentious. Keep searching for enlightenment, and we’ll keep pretending it’s impressive.",

    Tritannus: {description: "You’re the villain who can’t decide if he’s a literal fish out of water or just a guy who’s been overcompensating for his entire life. Sure, you’ve got power, but you’re way too focused on proving you’re the ‘baddest’ one in the room. Newsflash: No one’s scared of someone who can’t get their life together long enough to actually *use* their powers. Maybe take a break from the whole ‘evil overlord’ act and get some therapy.",

    },
    
    Palladium: {description: "Oh, you’re the wise mentor who’s *always* telling everyone what to do, but somehow never gets around to actually doing anything yourself. You talk a big game, but when it comes time to lead, you’re the one who’s standing in the back, hiding behind your ‘experience.’ How about instead of giving advice, you actually show everyone what leadership looks like? Just a suggestion.",

    },
    
    Darkar: {description: "You’re the classic villain who thinks he’s terrifying because he talks about darkness and power in every sentence. But let’s be honest—no one’s scared of someone who’s so desperate for attention they have to keep repeating how ‘evil’ they are. Maybe if you spent less time monologuing and more time actually being competent, you wouldn’t have to constantly remind us how much of a threat you are.",
